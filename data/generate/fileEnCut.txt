shenzhen hk stock link likely in second quarter ubs 

the chinese mainland will likely announce the launch of the much anticipated 
stock trading link between the shenzhen and hong kong exchanges in the second 
quarter of the year further opening the mainland s stock market to overseas 
investors a senior analyst at ubs securities said on wednesday 

if the link is launched this year it would mean that about percent of market 
capitalization of the a shares will be available to overseas investors who already 
gained access to the mainland market through the existing shanghai hong kong 
stock connect said gao ting chief china equities strategist at ubs securities 

the link will broaden investors stock selection in the mainland as the shenzhen 
market unlike shanghai is home to many high tech innovative companies and 
private firms with high growth potential gao said 

the trading link will increase the investment opportunities for overseas investors 
in sectors including healthcare consumption material and information technology 
he said at a news conference in beijing 

premier li keqiang said in march that the central government will seek to launch the 
shenzhen hong kong stock connect this year 

bloomberg reported earlier citing people familiar with the matter that the launch 
of the trading link may be announced before july it quoted a spokesman for the 
hong kong exchanges clearing ltd as saying that a preparatory period of three to 
four months will be needed following the announcement of regulatory approval 

while overseas investors can already invest in the mainland s stock market under the 
qualified foreign institutional investors program the launch of the shenzhen hong 
kong stock connect still holds symbolic significance as it will signal a further 
opening of the capital market analysts said 

zhao wenli an analyst at china merchants securities hk co ltd said in a 
research note that good quality and reasonably priced small and mid cap stocks 
under the trading link will attract greater attention from foreign investors
